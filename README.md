# deepnado

This repository contains an Deep Learning Ai/Ml model inspired by the Tornet baseline model using PyTorch.

## Improvements

TODO - Detail what improvements are made in this repository over the original

# Getting Started

The author recommends use of a python virtual environment.

1. python -m venv venv
2. . ./venv/bin/activate
3. pip install -e .

To install testing and code quality packages, use ```pip install -e .[test]``` to install those.
To install packages required to display plots, use ```pip install -e .[plotting]``` to install those.

## Usage

The Command Line Interface (CLI) is the primary interface while using deepnado.  The CLI is used to run the
deepando program. The help menu will document all commands and abilities.

To get help menu, run  ```deepnado -h ```.

# Scripts

The scripts folder is not included in the python package, but is present for developers to test out
new ideas.  Please see the script folder [README](./scripts/README.md)
